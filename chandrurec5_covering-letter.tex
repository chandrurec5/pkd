%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am interested in applying for the position of Assistant Professor in the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical Engineering at IIT Palakkad(Ref: Advertisement No. IITPKD/R/F/01/2017).

I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow in the Department of Computing Sciences at the University of Alberta. My area of specialization is Reinforcement Learning (RL), a branch of Machine Learning, and I obtained my Ph.D (2010-2016) and Masters (2008-2010) degree from IISc, Bangalore, and Bachelors degree from NIT, Trichy (2001-2005). Prior to my Masters at IISc, I worked as an Analog Design Engineer at Cosmic Circuits Pvt Ltd, Bangalore for a period of 3 years (2005-2008). I am also a recipient of the DST, Inspire Faculty Scholarship (July Batch 2016).

I would like to describe myself as a passionate academician who likes research work and teaching. I believe that my research and industry experience will prove to be extremely useful as a faculty at IIT Palakkad. I would like to contribute towards course work development and establishment of a RL laboratory. I also think that there is much to gain for me from the energy and inquisitiveness of the future engineers at IIT Palakkad. I would also like to mention that I would be keen to choose IIT Palakkad as my host institute as a part of fulfilling my Inspire Faculty Scholarship requirements. I am furnishing the other required documents (curriculum vitae, teaching plan, research proposal, list of publications/patents and three of my best papers) and I kindly request you to peruse the same and provide due consideration to my application.
